Ruby on Rails authentication and authorization practice application via The Odin Project.

This is an exercise in "rolling your own authentication" system in Rails. Signed-in users can create posts and see the authors of the other posts. When a user signs out, their cookie is deleted, and they can no longer create new posts. Additionally, the authors of the existing posts switch to "Anonymous".

In order to log in, use:

Name: kyle

Email: kyle@yahoo.com

Password: foobar
