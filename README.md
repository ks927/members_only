Ruby on Rails authentication and authorization practice application via The Odin Project.

This is an exercise in "rolling your own authentication" system in Rails. Signed-in users can create posts and see the authors of the other posts. When a user signs out, their cookie is deleted, and they can no longer create new posts. Additionally, the authors of the existing posts switch to "Anonymous".
